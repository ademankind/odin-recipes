    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds cubed beef stew meat</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 pound carrots, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>4 large potatoes, cubed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried parsley</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups boiling water</li>
        <li>2 (1 ounce) envelopes onion soup mix</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>3 large onions, quartered</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>½ cup burgundy wine</li>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) packages fresh button mushrooms, halved</li>
        <li>¼ cup warm water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Toss the beef, flour, and salt in a sealable bag until the beef is coated.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Combine the beef and Worcestershire sauce in the skillet; cook until the beef is evenly browned on all sides; transfer to a slow cooker, but do not clean the skillet. Add the carrots, potatoes, parsley, and pepper to the slow cooker.</li>
        <li>Combine the boiling water and soup mix in a small bowl; add to slow cooker.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in the skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the onion and garlic in the melted butter until soft; transfer the onion and garlic to the slow cooker and return the skillet to the heat. Combine the wine and mushrooms to the skillet; cook until the mushrooms begin to absorb the wine; pour the mixture into the slow cooker.</li>
        <li>Place the cover on the slow cooker and set to High; cook for one hour. Reduce heat to Low and cook until the beef is fork-tender, 6 to 8 hours. Whisk together the warm water and cornstarch; stir into the stew; cook uncovered until stew thickens, about 15 minutes.</li>
